### Course Discription
This course is the first course in the UCB CS61 series. It mainly uses Python as a carrier to explain the structure of programs and the principles of interpretation from an abstract perspective. This course can be divided into four chapters: function-oriented programming, object-oriented programming, interpretation principles, and simple data processing (sql). This course includes four projects in total, a web game for dice rolling and typing exercises (using function-oriented programming), a game of ants vs bees that imitates Plants vs. Zombies (using object-oriented programming, you will know how various game mods are made after finishing it), and a interpreter written in scheme language in Python that can complete basic calculation functions.

The course looks at programming from an abstract perspective, understands the overall structure and interpretation of computer programs, and allows us to achieve very interesting things such as writing games and interpreter when we only have little programming knowledge, so that we can more clearly understand how programming comes from, and learning programming is no longer boring and confusing, but we understand that we can complete specific tasks.

### Learning Stratgy
My learning process is Textbook - Lab - Homework - Project. I will only look at the recording when I really don’t understand something.

For beginners, it is not recommended to spend too much time on challenge problems. These questions are too difficult and you may not be able to complete one in a few hours, which is not worth the effort. There are a lot of recursion exercises in the course assignments, which will definitely give you a deep understanding of recursion.

Workload: About 100 hours for beginners.

### Useful Link
I am studying 2021Fall because there is more content. Unfortunately, it seems that the course websites of previous years require a UCB account to view them.

### 课程介绍
这门课是UCB CS61系列中的第一门课，主要以python为载体，讲解了从抽象角度了解程序的结构以及编译原理。本节课可以分为四个章节，面向过程编程，面向对象编程，编译原理，以及简单的数据处理（sql）。本课程一共包含的四个项目，一个掷骰子和打字练习的网页游戏（使用面向过程编程），一个仿造植物大战僵尸的ants vs bees的游戏（使用面向对象编程，做完你就知道各种游戏mod是怎么做出来的了），用python写一个scheme语言的编译器，能完成基本的计算功能。

课程从抽象的视角来看待编程，了解计算机程序总体的结构以及编译，让我们在仅掌握少量编程知识的时候便可以实现很有意思的事情比如写游戏写编译器，使得我们可以更清晰的清楚编程是怎么来的，学习编程不再枯燥迷茫，而是明白自己可以完成具体的任务。

### 如何学习
本人的学习流程为Textbook - Lab - Homework - Project. 实在碰到没明白的才会去看recording。

对于初学者而言不建议把时间过多的耗在challenge problems上面，这些题目过于困难很可能几个小时都完成不了一道，得不偿失。课程作业中有大量的递归练习，做完一定会让你对递归有很深的理解。

工作量：初学者来说约为100小时。

本人学习的是2021Fall，因为内容更多一些。很遗憾，现在往年的课程网站似乎需要UCB账号才能查看了。
